                <!-- Add a short bio or introduction here -->
                <p> Hello, my name is Vedat, and I am currently in my second year at InHolland University and Applied
                    Sciences, where I am studying software development and web design. I have always been passionate about
                    creating and developing innovative software systems and websites, and in my spare time, I enjoy cooking
                    and trying out new recipes.<br> <br>
                    One of my passions is sharing my culinary creations with others, which is why I decided to create this
                    website. On this site, you will find a collection of recipes that I have found and tried from various
                    sources around the internet. I have also included some of my own original recipes that I have developed
                    over the years. <br> <br>
                    I hope that you will find something on this site that interests you and that you will enjoy my content.
                    Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and I hope you come back again soon!</p>
